# Zipxf
A little program I hacked together to zip an archive and unzip an archive.
Usage:
```bash
zipxf [-z] [-u] [-o outputName]
        CANNOT USE BOTH -z and -u
    -z  - Zips all files in Current Working Directory into an Archive(default: archive.zip)
    -u  - Unzips Archive
    -o  - Name of either output of New Archive(.zip) to Zip or Name of Archive(.zip) to Unzip
```
